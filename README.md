# Diamond-Price-Analysis-Prediction

Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called a diamond cubic. At room temperature and pressure, another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form of carbon, but diamond converts to it extremely slowly. Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material, properties that are used in major industrial applications such as cutting and polishing tools. They are also the reason that diamond anvil cells can subject materials to pressures found deep in the earth.


The main goal of this project is to perform extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Diamond (gemstone.csv) dataset and build an appropriate machine learning model.

It involves classical machine learning tasks tested with different models.
